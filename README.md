# WPF_Ticket_System

This was a school (SKP - skolepraktik) project.

I worked in the group of 3 people and we had to develop 3 new systems to optimize their work processes. The current solution for the 3 affected departments (Sales Department, Repair Department and Helpdesk) is task management in an Excel document, for each department, IT-Servicedesk therefore wants to decentralize work management, to reduce data errors and to give employees the opportunity to work on several tasks simultaneously. </br>

The following interfaces need to be developed:
* Sales Department - Web application,
* Repair Department - Windows application <b><-- This app which I made</b>
* Helpdesk - Android application .</br>

### System requirements were: </br>

* A Windows application (WPF) must be developed which must be able to register and control the following:
* Receipt of a form with name, address, telephone number, make, model serial number and a description of the task / problem with equipment.
* PC test
* If it is necessary to change parts in the equipment, the customer must be contacted to obtain an acceptance for the purchase of spare parts.
* PC repair
* When the repair is completed, the customer must be contacted and it is agreed when the customer picks up the equipment.
